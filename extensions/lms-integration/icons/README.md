# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in various sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Requirements

- PNG format
- Square dimensions
- Transparent background
- Professional appearance
- Consistent with ProfGini branding

## Temporary Placeholder

For development/testing, you can create simple colored squares with the ProfGini "P" logo or use the university's colors.

Actual icons should be created by a designer and follow Chrome Web Store guidelines.
